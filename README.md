# audio_static_image_video_generator_1
Efficiently convert audio and static image into a video by concatenating a seed loop.

These are two simple wrapper scripts using ffmpeg and Pillow to do the heavy lifting.
They were generated using Gemini.
One is a command line utility (with slight adaptions) and a Qt app using PySide6.
