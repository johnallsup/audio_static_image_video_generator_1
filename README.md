# Audio Static Image Vidoe Generator 1
Efficiently convert audio and static image into a video by concatenating a seed loop.

These are two simple wrapper scripts using ffmpeg and Pillow to do the heavy lifting.
They were generated using Gemini.
One is a command line utility (with slight adaptions) and a Qt app using PySide6.

This was kind of an experiment in vibe coding, with something that nobody's 
life depends upon. I just asked Gemini for a few things, and the result is what
you find here.

Its purpose is to scratch an itch that some of us have when we want to 
quickly upload an audio file to Youtube. Creating a whole video in a video editor
takes time, even for a static image, and rendering also takes time,
much longer than is necessary using this method.

## Icons
The icons are just the result of asking Gemini for one once the working
program was finished.
